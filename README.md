# ISL9402 clone
script for quick cloning of ISL9402 parameters in production. ISL9402_clone.py -w.
a master file with settings can be made with the configured BMS key ISL9402_clone.py -r or use ISL94202_EEPROM_Form.xlsm.
For example, the setting of some registers with temperature is implemented. The temperature is set in degrees Celsius ISL9402_clone.py -set DOT -20.
You cannot use the manufacturer's software support. xlsm, VB6 in 2022 is not funny. Only windows and old Microsoft Excel.
As necessary, settings for other registers will be added.
